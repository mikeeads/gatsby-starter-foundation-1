What does the Internet of the future look like?

Think back ten years ago. The Internet of 2003 is significantly different than the Internet of 2013.

Much has been written on this topic already but here I will summarize what I see the future of the Internet and of technology, in general, looking like.

## The Age of Context

Incremental improvements in hardware design, quality, and speed will continue. However, as in recent years, the biggest value moving forward is going to be through software. This is a trend that has been happening for several years now. Software is where it is at.

Context means situational awareness. Collecting information quickly then responding to the world around us. As humans, we do it almost unconsciously. There are a lot of situations, however, in modern life that our brains obviously cannot handle the deluge of information that is available today. This is where technology is here for the rescue.

This certainly isn’t new. Just think of all the things already made contextual:

* Advertising — This is the beauty of internet marketing — improving the quality of the interaction with a potential client or customer
* Google news knows where you are and shows you local news
* Google Now and Siri (Apple recently [acquired Cue](https://appleinsider.com/articles/13/10/03/rumor-apple-may-have-acquired-personal-assistant-app-cue-for-at-least-35m), a personal assistant service similar to Google Now for $60m)
* All of our smart devices that know whether you want landscape or portrait mode
* Reading apps that automatically adjust screen brightness and color based on the time of day
* The M7 chip in Apples new phones does motion sensing — this is contextual information!
* Anti-lock brakes (been around [for decades](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anti-lock_braking_system)), Electronic stability control, or cruise control that keeps your distance from the car in front of you.
* The fire alarm in our homes.
* Amazon or Netlix’s relevant products recommendation features
* Goodread
* In enterprise storage, [FAST](http://www.emc.com/corporate/glossary/fully-automated-storage-tiering.htm). Fully automated storage tiering. It just knows.

We could think of dozens more. Obviously the Age of Context is already here.

## Sensors

The proliferation of increasingly affordable sensors allows for more and more data to be collected about people, processes, machines, and things. The more data collected about us as we interact with technology, the more contextualized our experience can be. It isn’t just about collecting more and more data, it is about taking that data to improve our business and improve our lives.

This is the future. The ability to collect and accurately analyze personal or situational information will continue to lead us to a future full of increasingly contextual applications. Applications that are increasingly smart. They will help us be more productive. They will help us see only things that are relevant. This is one of the most important tech trends today.

## Enter the Internet of Everything

The virtual conversations going on all around us are expanding. They are not just expanding in number, they are exploding!

According to Cisco, more than [37 billion](http://blogs.cisco.com/ioe/the-internet-of-everything-has-begun/) new things will be connected to the Internet by 2020.

The Internet of Everything (IoE) is the networked connection of people, process, data, and things and the increased value that occurs as “everything” comes online. The IoE literally means E-V-E-R-Y-T-H-I-N-G- Ideas don’t get broader in scope or more impactful than this.

This phenomenon is what is enabling and what will continue to enable [the mesh](http://rcm-na.amazon-adsystem.com/e/cm?lt1=_blank&bc1=000000&IS2=1&bg1=FFFFFF&fc1=000000&lc1=0000FF&t=shayousaw0f-20&o=1&p=8&l=as4&m=amazon&f=ifr&ref=ss_til&asins=B0043RSIZU)— the sharing economy. Selling one thing multiple times (think *Zip Car*, *Netflix*,*Spotify*).

Between technologies such as **hadoop** and other big data analytics platforms,**IPv6** to allow each of the billions of nodes in the IoE to have a unique address, and increasingly inexpensive **sensors,** this phenomenon is coming ever closer to reality.

Another way to describe it is that it connects the physical world to the internet by using microsensors on the network to make everyday objects become connected and intelligent.

## Metcalf’s Law

Think of Metcalf’s Law. The value of a network increases proportionality to the square of the number of users. When billions (or even trillions) of people, processes, data, and things on this vast network around the world, the value will be enormous. World changing.

This is a huge opportunity. Hundreds of billions, even trillions of dollars of opportunity and value will be created over the coming decade. The vast majority of the physical world is currently NOT connected to the internet.

Think of the customer experiences possible in the internet of everything when you can know exactly who your customer is and how they interact with your products. Think of the innovation that will happenin a world when you have trillions of data points to create from. In business, the **asset utilization and supply chain efficiency** when you know exactly when and where every single product or resource is available. The benefits go on and on.

## What does this mean?

Skate to where the puck is going. The pace of change of course is not going to slow down and businesses must not passively wait for new opportunities provided by the IoE. Change or die.
